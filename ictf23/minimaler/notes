was about to go bath and sleep
then my teammate @linz told me that minimaler is the same as minimal

So I just kept running my minimal exploit on this chall and it worked
Maybe there was a cheese in the minimal chall, and the authors patched it in this one



the error messages given by ./run.sh keeps making my exploit think it found libc
So just ignore those
