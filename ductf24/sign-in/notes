user is an object
and user_list is linked list blocks used to make a link list

aim is to set uid=0
overwrite it? integer overflow it?


vuln might be that it doesn't nullify 
entry->next when you make an account

so maybe you can make a fake user object with uid 0 and use entry->next to point to it

and no need write into known memory
I just have to point it to null memory
since if its

0x00000000
0x00000000
0x00000000

then password and user is just null right


this also works because size of user_entry is the same as user


wait no I have to overwrite next with a user_list object
I have to overwrite with a ptr that points to a ptr that points to 0x00000000

found one:
0x00000000004006e0 -> 0x0000000000403ff8 -> 0x0000000000000000

it should work, since logging into an account doesn't make changes to the object
so read only memory is fine

nvm this doesnt work, password is a libc address, so got aslr



0x0000000000402eb8â”‚+0x27d8: 0x00000000004003d8
0x4003d8:       0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x4003e8:       0x0000000000000000
