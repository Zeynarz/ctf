I tried this codes as flags and they didnt work
I didnt know where to continue from this point on, and wanted to ask the author, so I visited their discord channel
author said that the codes werent the flag, and there was a next part 
(at this point I alr wanted to look at the boarding pass again and see stuff)

I kept on reading and author dropped a hint in discord "just check the boarding pass carefully you may find a clue/s hidden on it. "
