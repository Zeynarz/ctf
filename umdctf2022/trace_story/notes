Is the objective to read the story? We can try to attach to the process and read the buffer?
ptrace?

We can try ptracing into the child process, and before the child process executes the open 
syscall,we can modify the args of the syscall so that it opens flag instead of readstory.txt

Read the flag then write the flag contents in the "Finished" buffer to print the flag?

How do debuggers ptrace to a process when the tracee doesnt call ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME,...)
PTRACE_ATTACH

in C:
#define PTRACE_ATTACH 16
#define PTRACE_PEEKUSER 3

ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH,childPid,0,0)
ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER,childPid,44,0)

in asm:
// ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH,childPid,0,0)
mov rax,SYS_ptrace
mov rdi,0x10
mov rsi,childPid
mov rdx,0
mov r10,0
syscall

// ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER,childPid,44,0)
mov rax,SYS_ptrace
mov rdi,0x3
mov rsi,childPid
mov rdx,0x2c
mov r10,0
syscall
