getnum() just returns the number typed in integer form

main:
   choice 1: set username
   choice 2: print username
   choice 1337: play game

game:
    if you can guess the random number generated by /dev/urandom, you get a shell
    (pretty sure /dev/urandom is a secure RNG)

    read one byte from the fileName

set_username:
    amount = strlen(NAME) 
    then read for "amount" bytes

print_username:
    puts(NAME)
