NAME = 0x5555555580a0

NAME is directly above RANDBUF 
RANDBUF is holding a the fileName string

set_username uses strlen to determine len of string,if at the beginning name is 32 bytes,
strlen would also include the len of RANDBUF and I could write 38 bytes

Could also use this to leak the RANDBUF address

after leaking the RANDBUF address,overwrite it with the address pointing to /bin/sh
and since the first byte in /bin/sh is constant, can win the game
