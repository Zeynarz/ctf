Nothing special in main,only called the wait function

wait:
    reads a number (maximum 5 digits) and converts it to a long
    The magic number is probably a leak
    the number read is used to be part of the format string
    if the number read is d
    magic number is %d$lx

    original format string:
    %%%d$llx

introduce just calls get_num_bytes

get_num_bytes:
   Ask how many bytes you want to read (n)
   reads n bytes then echoes it to the terminal

echo:
    There is a 256 bytes buffer
    Reads n bytes into buffer
    (Null byte is set so no strlen vuln , but maybe can have a one byte overwrite?)
    prints the buffer
