what: 0x7fffffffe27c (4 bytes)
where: 0x7fffffffe280 (9 bytes)

puts@got = 0x404018

if overwrite exit@got,can get infinite loop
if overwrite atoi@got with system,then can just type /bin/sh and get shell

Exploitation
--------------
   0x00000000004011e0 <+55>:    mov    rdi,rax
   0x00000000004011e3 <+58>:    call   0x401030 <puts@plt>

before calling exit,rax is the "where" we entered

first write -> overwrite exit@got to 0x4011e0 to get unlimited loop and setup libc leak
second write -> overwrite 4 bytes before stdout to "AAAA",so after exit,stdout will be leaked
third write -> overwrite exit@got to main to get rid of movaps issue using the push at the beginning
fourth write -> overwrite atoi@plt to libc system

after that,just type sh when the program asks where and will hopefully a get shell
