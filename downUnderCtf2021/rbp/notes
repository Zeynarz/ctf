Reverse:
    program justs asks for your name (24 bytes) and stores it on the stack
    Then asks for a number and adds the number to rbp

can most probably make it so that rsp is the name buffer using leave
leave : rsp = rbp, pop rbp

nameBuffer = 0x7fffffffe2b0
rbp = 0x7fffffffe2d0

rbp - 0x20 = nameBuffer

also have to account for pop rbp
so favourite num = -0x20 - 8 = -40

only can write 24 bytes,so ROPChain can only have 3 gadgets/addresses (need 4 gadgets/addrs to leak libc)

Maybe can call main again and create one more buffers

Gadgets in the buffer could be, popRdi,putsPlt,add Rsp ? and add the stack pointer to point to the first buffer
and continue execution there

So our ROPChain can have 5*8 bytes 


pwntools aslr off
1st Buffer = 0x7fffffffe310
2nd Buffer = 0x7fffffffe2f0

add rsp during addr = 0x7fffffffe300 
want to set rsp to = 0x7fffffffe318
