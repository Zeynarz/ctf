/proc/[pid]/comm (since Linux 2.6.33)
       This file exposes the process's comm value—that is, the
       command name associated with the process.  Different
       threads in the same process may have different comm
       values, accessible via /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/comm.  A
       thread may modify its comm value, or that of any of other
       thread in the same thread group (see the discussion of
       CLONE_THREAD in clone(2)), by writing to the file
       /proc/self/task/[tid]/comm.  Strings longer than
       TASK_COMM_LEN (16) characters (including the terminating
       null byte) are silently truncated.

getppid() returns the process ID of the parent of the calling process.

so like
bash(132204)───yoyo(132432)
yoyo's parent is bash

bash(130747)───gdb(131827)───thanks4allthefish(131871)
thanks4allthefish's parent is gdb

so getppid just returns like the current parent, not like the final/biggest parent process, which will be
systemd(1)



/bin/grep tidbits /proc/*/comm

it greps from ALL process' comm
