(for 64 bit)
first 5 args of a func use registers prob
then 6th arg start using stack

0x007fffffffe000
ret = 0x007fffffffe078

local_78 is 104 bytes big
but could read 108 bytes

if u write 105 bytes, will overwrite stack cookie
So overwrite __stack_chk_fail got to one_gadget

and profit


cant put the addresses at the start since printf will stop printing once it reaches a null byte
(since strings end with a null byte)
