no boundary check on modify and list target
just leak the rwx memory region addr
and ret to there

ghidra says that local_1c is unsigned
but __isoc99_scanf("%d",&local_1c);
a decimal ("%d") is read into local_1c, not "%u"
so negative numbers prob still work

since scanf is reading in decimals, and it stores the decimal in local_1c



targets =  0x007fffffffdff0 
performAction ret = 0x007fffffffdfd8
rwx region addr in 0x007fffffffdfe8

-1 to leak rwx region addr
-3 to overwrite performAction ret
