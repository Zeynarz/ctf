I've been wanting to learn more abt kernel pwn and get better at it for a while now. It's rly fun and interesting   
So I'm gonna try to upsolve some prev ctf kernel pwn challs, some maybe without looking at writeups, some maybe looked at writeups slightly for hints when stuck, and some maybe just follow writeups and use writeups as walkthroughs.      
idk if there's any like pwn challange site specifically for kernel pwn stuff, would be cool if there is one, but even if there isn't, you can't rly go wrong with upsolving prev challs, and can still learn a ton and have a lot of fun doing it.
