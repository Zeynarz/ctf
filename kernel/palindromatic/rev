a queue of requests are made
a request object is stored in the kernel cache

queue->front stores the index of the first request object
queue->rear stores the index of the last request object


what's the size of arg_t?
its supposed to be just a ptr to userspace?
I am pretty sure that's the case

kzalloc is just kmalloc but then afterwards zero out the chunk
