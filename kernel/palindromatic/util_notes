notes about kernel pwn utilities
------------------------------------
a pwn player called @nasm suggested me to use https://github.com/bata24/gef for kernel pwn
and man it actually has so many features and is so useful for debugging stripped vmlinuxes
its actually so good, and has so many good features for kernel pwn
it has like slub-dump and ksymaddr-remote which is so cool

to make changes to the file system loaded (the .ext3 file), just mount it:
sudo mount file.ext3 /mnt
and edit/add the files in /mnt. very simple and convenient

since the kernel binary has no symbols, I can't find whr the palindromatic kernel module functions are.
but to find them, you can just take a look at
/sys/module/palindromatic/sections/.text

but you have to be root in order to view them, so just edit the uid in the init file at / in the ext3
file system so that the uid is 0
