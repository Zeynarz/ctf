rly hard chall for my skill level, but you've alr read part of the writeup on wall-of-perdition before, and i rmb u getting ur mind blown by it, so might as well try reading fire-of-salvation's writeup and actually following it this time.
fire-of-salvation is easier than wall-of-perdition, thats why im choosing it

can learn a huge ton abt kernel heap and how to exploit it

can get the challange files here:
