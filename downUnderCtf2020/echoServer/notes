format string exploit
failed = leak libc(Using the info on the stack) -> overwrite ret to ret to main so we have more inputs -> overwrite second ret to popRdi -> write binsh onto stack -> write system onto stack
leak addresses -> rewrite Var -> setup ret2libc -> rewriteVar -> shell
maybe need set stack
8th format argument is own input
after some fiddling,found out that 3rd format arg prints out readAddress+18 19th format arg is libc_main + 243
cant overwrite got cause full relro is active
cant fit all of the exploit in three inputs so gotta return back to the function
need to follow order so it doesnt messes up the bytes infront 
IMPORTANT = maximum input is 64 chars
movaps need rsp/16 
0xffff = 65535 so 5 spaces
