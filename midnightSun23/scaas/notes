use cyber chef to convert og file to elf file


didn't rly read finish the code but pretty sure that scaas just mmaps a rwx region, 
copy input to there, and run it 

the input supposedly should only be alphanumeric

can't use nullbyte to get past the alphanumeric check cause strlen is used to determine how 
many bytes is copied to the memory region



for some reason, if shellcode len = 0x100
$ecx   : 0x2a83b080



nvm, no need craft own shellcode
just

msfvenom -a x86 --platform linux -p linux/x86/exec CMD=/bin/sh -e x86/alpha_mixed BufferRegister=EDX

(spent a lot of time crafting own shellcode, then remembered that the chall category was autopwn. bruh.
So I just googled autopwn and found msfvenom.)
