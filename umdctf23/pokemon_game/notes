a lil heap overflow
rand seed no set so the sequence of random numbers are always the same


adventurerObj       : "A"*16
adventurerObj+0x10  : abilities (treated as a char)
adventurerObj+0x14  : balls_used (int)
adventurerObj+0x18  : pokemon caught prob
adventurerObj+0x1c  : caughtPokemonObj1
                    : caughtPokemonObj2 
                    : ...


.bss? : pokemonListGlo (a heap addr)

pokemonListGlo: null  pokemonObj

(in heap too)
pokemonObj:  charPtr    id(prob)     randNum(1-100)


"bulbasaur" etc strings are stored in the .text segment



need to use the pokemonIds to make shellcode
