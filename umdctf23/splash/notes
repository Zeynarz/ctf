there is a buffer overflow
just overflow arceus's splashPp to 0 and fight

or just up the splashPp till the int becomes neg (cause MSB is 1, two's complement)
(ghidra says that splashPp is unsigned tho, did ghidra just make a mistake??)
(printf uses %d tho, not %u)

(just confirmed with organizers, in the source code, splashPp is a signed int)

choice = 0x7fffffffdc80
