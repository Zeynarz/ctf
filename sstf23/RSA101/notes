This answer explains it very well

To get m**d mod n
you first get s1 = m1 ** d mod n,  m2 = m*inv(m1)
then get      s2 = m2 ** d mod n

then to get s, s = s1*s2 mod n


This is because
s2 = s1*s2 mod n
s2 = (m1 ** d) * (m*inv(m1))**d mod n
s2 = m1 ** d * inv(m1) ** d * m ** d mod n
s2 = (m1 * inv(m1)) ** d * m ** d mod n
s2 = 1 **d * m ** d mod n
s2 = m ** d mod n
