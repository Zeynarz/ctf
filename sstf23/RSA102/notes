I really have no idea on how to solve this.
So I went on to look at the tutorial guide for the first time in this ctf
And the solution is actually very very cool

Its called the RSA common modulus attack
c1 * c2 mod n = (m ** e1)(m ** e2) mod n = m ** (e1+e2) mod n
If there's a way to get e1+e2 mod n = 1, then that would be great
since both e1 and e2 are primes, gcd(e1,e2) = 1

So we can use extended gcd to find u and v, such that
u(e1) + v(e2) = 1

Thus when we do c1**u * c2**v mod n, we get
(m**e1)**u * (m**e2)**v mod n = m ** (u*e1) * m ** (v*e2) mod n 
which is equals to
m ** (u*e1 + v*e2) mod n

which is just
m mod n

very very cool.





(I skipped to the final quiz part as there's only 40 mins left in the ctf, maybe I should try quiz #1 and quiz #2 too soon)
