use the padding to gain information?
padding attack?


a quick google search:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack#Padding_oracle_attack_on_CBC_encryption

After just quickly scanning through this, and mostly thinking abt it myself.
I think the attack works like this:

use just 1 ciphertext, and keep changing the last byte of the IV, until "Wrong Ciphertext"
pops up, cause that way we know that the last byte of pt is now b"\x01"

So since we know what IV[-1] and pt[-1] is, we know what ctAfterAES[-1] is.
Thus we can easily change IV[-1] so that pt[-1] becomes b"\x02", and try the same
approach as before on IV[-2]. We keep changing IV[-2] until we get "Wrong Ciphertext",
then we do the same for IV[-3],IV[-4] and so on.

This way, we at most only have to try 0x100 different bytes on each IV
So at most, we only need 0x100*16 = 4096 attempts, instead of 
0x100**16 = 0x100000000000000000000000000000000 attempts

Very cool.
