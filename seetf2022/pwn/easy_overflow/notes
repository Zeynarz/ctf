(gdb with aslr off)
buf = 0x7fffffffe170 (32 bytes)
rbp = 0x7fffffffe190
ret = 0x7fffffffe198 (checked if it is 0x401212)


set vuln stack frame *rbp to 0x404038 (puts@got + 0x20), after vuln leaves (execute leave), and the program 
is in the main stack frame, rbp will now be 0x404038, and fgets() will read into 0x404018. 

Write the addr of win function (0x401249) and puts will call win
