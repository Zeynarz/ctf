I think this works:

'a\' ... ' ... '\a'

just have to make sure that the whole thing is odd length
and the code is put in the second ...
and the palindrome of the code is put in the first ...
and have to make sure that the sum of all chars % 256 == 69

nvm it doesnt work, eval only evaluates expressions, and this is not an expression
unless we use add?
YUP THAT WORKS, niceuuuuuuu.

thanks stackoverflow

for some reason chars like t etc doesn't work rly


wait I didn't realise the no more than 35 chars thing
I have to somehow shrink the exploit to only 35 chars

oh wait its a while loop dude
I can store my input in like a variable first, then only eval it after
oh wait no it has to be an expression AHHHHHHHHHHH

yo hold up


'm!\'+)(tupni+'+input()+'\!m'
'0\'+_+'+_+'\0'

nah it doesn't work on scripts, ahh



how do I remove two bytes from this:
'0\'+))(tupni(lave+'+eval(input())+'\0'

didn't manage to solve this chall, ahhh
