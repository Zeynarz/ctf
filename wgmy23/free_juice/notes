format string vuln in secretJuice
and also buffer overflow in secretJuice
secretJuice() is not gatekeeped as well, so you can keep calling it

you can malloc after malloc since you can choose unlimited juices

the intended solution is definetely house of orange

the thing is only 0x120 sized chunks can be used

wait can I just use the format string vuln to cheese the challange, and overwrite free_hook? 
since I have all the leaks in the world?

wait no you can't do that since you can't write null bytes
wait no, YOU CAN do it, just leave the address at the end
