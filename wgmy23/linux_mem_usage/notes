if its an object*, and you want to access the property, you use object->property right?

if its just an "object", and you want to access its property, just use object.property right?

it hit the time limit, do I need to use dynamic programming?
maybe I need to store the totalmem of a process once I calculated it, that prob will help reduce the time

yup, that works
