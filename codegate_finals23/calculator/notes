null byte overwrite ?


notepad 0x100 bytes, then write next to it is expression
read wont null byte intiialize right?

buffer overflow in note function
just need libc leak now

the calculator checks for alphanumeric?
I typed "A+1" into the calc and got a leak lol
very cool


during the buffer overflow
$rdi   : 0x00007fffffffbe00  →  0x00007ffff7df70d0  →  <funlockfile+0> endbr64


so we can just ret to a putsPlt and ret back to _start
