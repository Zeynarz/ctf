from what I understand, we have full control over our physical address in the vm?
and can use devmem to write to it and read from it?

devmem width is in bits prob

is the pci struct in host memory? or what? 
maria object is in qemu process memory


pieBase = 0x55641e7be000
buffer = 0x55642250d1a0,  pieBase+0x3d4f1a0

buffer+0x2000+0x48 = mmio+0x48 = read/write function pointers
buffer+0x2000+0x50 = mmio+0x50 = opaque = first arg passed into the read write



(gdb) info proc
process 15
cmdline = '/home/user/qemu-system-x86_64 -L /home/user/bios -kernel /home/user/bzImage -initrd /home/user/initramfs.cpio.gz -cpu kvm64,+smep,+smap -monitor none -m 1024M -append console=ttyS0 oops=panic panic=1 quiet -monitor /dev/null -nographic -no-reboot -net user -net nic -device e1000 -device maria -sandbox on,obsolete=deny,elevateprivileges=deny,spawn=deny,resourcecontrol=deny'
cwd = '/'
exe = '/home/user/qemu-system-x86_64'

I can prob just view the flag?
no need to execute chroot or anything
found an absolute banger of a gadget

0x00000000007bce54 : push rax ; pop rsp ; nop ; pop rbp ; ret

we can control rax with opaque, since when the function is called
both rdi and rax = opaque
