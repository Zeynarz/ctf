n isn't initialized in getline
its prob a uninitialized var vuln

getline@plt (
   $rdi = 0x00007fffffffe228 → 0x0000000000000000,
   $rsi = 0x00007fffffffe1f0 → 0x0000000000000008,
   $rdx = 0x00007ffff7fa1aa0 → 0x00000000fbad208b,
   $rcx = 0x00007fffffffe1f0 → 0x0000000000000008
)

Ya there's definetely a buffer overflow here

oh, getline allocates a buffer on the heap, and puts the address into rdi
and the size inputted is stored in n?


the struct is at 0x7fffffffe220


getline doesn't check for the heap structure
or maybe it checks the size of the chunk not so thoroughly
oh, or maybe cause n is initialized to 8, so getline assumes that the chunk is 8 bytes


max write 6 bytes, otherwise realloc will be called, and 
 realloc(): invalid pointer


use libc.rip to find libc
a lot of libcs didnt work

just gonna guess that they use ubuntu 22.04 too
since the __libc_start_call_main same as mine

yup, its ubuntu 22.04
